            <h3>The 1950s</h3>
            <p>The racing industry saw tremendous change in the 1950s! Car designs constantly changed as teams competed for the top slot, with new advancements increasing. As drivers and engineers worked to push the limits of what was achievable on the track, these modifications did more than make minor adjustments to the sport; they changed the course of history. The 1950s saw new levels of invention and advancement in everything from rear-engine designs to aerodynamics.</p>

        <section id="1960s" class="timeline-section">
            <h3>The 1960s</h3>
            <p>With a heavy focus on developing speed and performance, teams and engineers pushed the envelope during this decade.One of the main areas of innovation was using new, lightweight materials to give drivers a competitive edge. Teams experimented with wings and other aerodynamic devices to increase downforce and grip, which allowed for faster cornering and higher top speeds, and the aerodynamics also played a significant role.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="1970s" class="timeline-section">
            <h3>The 1970s</h3>
            <p>The motorsports industry had a major transformation with the introduction of side-mounted radiators. The idea first applied in racing in the late 1960s, and teams experimented with it in 1968 and 1969. However,  side-mounted radiators gained popularity in the early 1970s. This ground-breaking design gave teams a fresh method of cooling their engines while challenging the accepted wisdom of overhead radiators and inboard brakes. Before this change, teams had mainly employed radiators in the nose, which had been the norm since Formula One's first year in 1950.</p>

            <h3>The 1980s</h3>
            <p>Formula One saw tremendous technological growth in the 1980s, with several new developments occurring during this time. Car design was completely transformed when carbon fiber composite materials were added to the chassis, making them much stronger, lighter, and more rigid. Because of this revolutionary invention, teams were able to push the boundaries of performance and change the way they approached car design.  </p>

        <section id="1990s" class="timeline-section">
            <h3>The 1990s</h3>
            <p>In the 1990s, motorsport fans will always remember as a time of achievements and tragedies. Anti-lock braking systems (ABS), for instance, were another revolutionary development in the sport. It gave drivers more control on the track by preventing wheel locking and brake imbalance, which was initially employed by the Williams Racing team. It and other driver aids like automated gearboxes and active suspension were outlawed in 1994 because they were thought to drastically diminish the value of human driving ability. </p>

        <section id="2000s" class="timeline-section">
            <h3>The 2000s</h3>
            <p>This era was about pushing technology's boundaries and implementing essential safety upgrades to protect drivers on the track. One in which advanced technology and computing power were more important than ever. Every team worked hard to maintain its lead and win the tournament.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="2010s" class="timeline-section">
            <h3>The 2010s</h3>
            <p>The 2010s introduced some of the quickest vehicles to the racetrack thanks to new formats and a constant search for speed. Drivers pushed themselves and their machines to the edge, shattering lap records at nearly every track. For instance, the brand-new Drag Reduction System (DRS) was the F-duct device. It was created to give drivers a significant edge when passing, boosting their chances of engaging in that elusive wheel-to-wheel competition we all adore.  </p>
        </section>

        <section id="2020s" class="timeline-section">
            <h3>The 2020s</h3>
            <p>Teams are pushing the boundaries and racing to dominate technology as innovation reaches an all-time high. And you can bet they're paying more attention to the rules than ever before because the entire globe is watching the sport. Thanks to computer technology, data is king, and contemporary automobiles are loaded with sensors that send critical data back to the teams. Every little aspect matters when attempting to outperform the competition, from tire pressure to fuel efficiency. However, in the 2020s, we will see changes in more than just technology. With a budget cap imposed in 2021 and new nations hosting races for the first time, the competition to see who will win is fierce.</p>
